1) The Task talks about a button element and then the learning points discuss using <a> link which seems counter intuitive.

2) At the end of this you don't really know if you have done everything correctly. It's very useful having the 'hints' to google and this does add to the learning for sure but at some point having the model code to look at would be great.
